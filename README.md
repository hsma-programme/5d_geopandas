# HSMA5: GeoPandas

**Welcome to the HSMA geopandas repo (5D)**.

## Module structure

> The module lecture slides are available in this repo, and the lecture is scheduled to take place on the afternoon of 31 January 2023.

##  Set up environment locally

You can either attempt these exercises via an online environment called [BinderHub](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hsma5/5d_geopandas/HEAD) (no local installs required).

To create and activate the `geopandas` environment follow the instructions below.

To create environment. Navigate to the `binder` folder.

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

To activate environment:

`conda activate geopandas`

To deactivate:

`conda deactivate`

To remove the environment (if desired):

`conda env remove -n geopandas`

## Description of materials.

We'll get straight into a guided code along before you'll work within your PSGs to complete an exercise.

### Code along notebooks

During the live session, we'll be working our way through a code along notebook; this can be found in the `code_along\` directory.

### Practical exercises notebook

The exercise notebook can be found in `exercise\` directory. This will follow a similar structure to the code along exercise. This exercise will be completed within your Peer Support Groups.
